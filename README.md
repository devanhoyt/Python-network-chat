# Python-network-chat
# Overview

This is a CLient/Server python chat that can be utilized on the same network or by configuring port forwarding to set up for system to system communication.
initialize the Server file first at the command line, and then initialize the client files for each client that connects.

This was made as a venture into networking to learn about the different capabilities and uses.
